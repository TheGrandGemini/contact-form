## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript (used if/else statement extensively && JS logic statement)

### What I learned

`html  `

I used the novalidate attribute to disabled the default text required input displayed

<form novalidate>...</form>
```

```js

** Everything I did using Js and its syntax are new experiences as this is the first project I am writing on my own using JS.. I practicesd the use of DOM Manipulation, if/else statements, callback function, event listener, logic statements and few others.. **
```

### Continued development

** I will continue mastering Javascript skill and also making my CSS better and more optimized and efficient **

### Useful resources

- -(http://www.w3schools.com/m)
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US) - This provided a lot of guidance to me whenever I faced some bugs/error, most especially when I was writing the Javascript script.. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
